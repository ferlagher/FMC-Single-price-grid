## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass <3
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Today I leanred that `box-shadow` it's a great property to make cool effects!

```scss
&:hover { //cool accordion transition
    transform: translateY(-15px);
    box-shadow: 0 10px 0 -4px #c0df3460,
        0 20px 0 -8px #c0df3460,
        0 16px 10px #c0df3460;
}
```

### Continued development

Transitions and animations are the funniest things to make in css. I'll continue adding them to future challenges!
